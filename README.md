## Description
This application allows users to share their thoughts, react to others thoughts, and create a friends list. This is a social network api which allows users to stay connected with others and has the ability to add and delete frineds. 

My motivation for this project was to create my own social platform to stay connected with others as well as connect with new friends. It is also helpful to know how to create and maintain your own network.
